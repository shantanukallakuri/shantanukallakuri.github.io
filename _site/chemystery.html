<p>Hello stranger, welcome and nice to meet you; thanks for taking the time to be here! 😀 <br />
<br />
My name is Shantanu Kallakuri. I am a recent graduate of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University">Cornell University</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BITS_Pilani">BITS Pilani</a> working on semiconductors for energy, optics, and electronics. I’m presently a process engineer at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_Materials">Applied Materials</a>, Santa Clara, working on advancing Plasma-enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_layer_deposition">(PE-ALD)</a> for next-generation semiconductor nodes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multigate_device">emergent transistor devices</a>. For more details on my past research and other work please refer to my CV <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x-r4d0o1Fnobrz_VEF1Ufuo9Ns1R7Se6/view">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>

<p>Applications of my past work mainly fall into these areas:<br />
1) energy-efficient electronic / optic / photonic devices<br />
2) self-assembled fibers &amp; thin-films with exotic properties like symmetry / chirality / magnetism<br />
3) self-assembled fibers to remedy heavy-metals like Arsenic and Lead from groundwater<br />
4) nanomotors for cheap point-of-care viral diagnostic micro-fluidic paper chips in developing nations and<br />
5) Dye sensitized solar cells and electron donor-acceptor systems<br /></p>

<p>My interests have led to the pursuit of an MS with <a href="https://ecommons.cornell.edu/items/81a31052-98cf-4e4b-986f-2acdd53f106e">thesis</a> at Cornell advised by Prof. Richard Robinson &amp; Prof. Tobias Hanrath where I was responsible for <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-022-01223-3.epdf?sharing_token=qK0xSPviChGM7xcUPUU6btRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0Mlj6L1ihnKIvTL2i9xTkHG6BafGwraN4s7XjNhzTsCkpUcjwSzj93HbnbM7HvIOFPm7m36QhXGbSzyqOPUa8uVHx-UmEPV7zgdeEQzPG_aG1Vi1ErkWx6UOTxHYr54Jic%3D">‘Developing multiscale hierarchical structures from nanocluster mesophases’</a>.

I love to brainstorm ideas and philosophies.</p>

<p>For the love of all things material!</p>

<h2 id="motivations">Motivations</h2>
<p>My fundamental interest lies in bottom-up materials chemistry approaches to help design and build functional materials starting from individual entities like atoms / quantum-dots / nanocrystals / small molecules using methods that require no intervention i.e. molecular self-assembly / directed self-assembly / amphiphilic self-assembly / atomic layer deposition / chemical vapor deposition. As most of these routes are self-spontaneous given right conditions; atoms &amp; molecules automatically assemble into anything we want them to, only limited by our imagination.</p>

<p>Reasons for this interest are mainly because such approaches massively amplify and enhance properties of those very individual entities in systematic low-entropy routes with high surface/volume ratios as opposed to bulk materials which have large disorder at the microscale and lower s/v. This consequently increases the efficacy of these properties and also makes possible to harness regular as well as exotic quantum properties (Like size-quantization or superconductivity).</p>

<h2 id="my-thesis">My thesis</h2>

<p>The question we’d been trying to answer with my thesis work was this: How can we emulate and compete with the supremely beautiful and complex self-assembly processes that nature usually follows in molecules like DNA and natural photonic structures (eg: butterfly wings) and what building blocks can we use to make this self-assembly happen. Self-assembly by itself has been a popular and well-known field but being able to generate a macroscale (bulk) structure starting directly from the atomic scale has been the focus of a large, challenging public body of work, and so far not accomplished to the 7 order of magnitude scales (nano to centi) that we have demonstrated in our work (1, 2, 3, 4)! The fact that we were able to build a system to harness these atomic properties without property loss in bulk material, but without the use of million-dollar semconductor lithography/fabrication/epitaxial equipment and using just some beakers and chemicals in a lab is exciting. Our postdoc Haixiang Han and I were able to successfully build this system together in Prof. Richard Robinson’s lab at Cornell.</p>

<p>The challenge here lay in finding a suitable building block as most such blocks today assemble only across a couple of orders of magnitude (They are unable to cover the full-scale ranging from invisible atomic scale to visible bulk centimeter scale that we can see visually, because of various reasons like solvent interactions, surface charges, unwanted electric fields, solute interactions, grain boundaries, and many more limitations). The entire assembly thus becomes very challenging to control as there is bound to be some scale, either nano, micro, milli, or centi in which this property-break or disorder would occur.</p>

<p>Now bulk materials here refer to the everyday macro-scale matter we see around us like keys, books, pencils, trees, plastic, cans, furniture, etc. everything, which as mentioned earlier no matter how ordered usually have some microcracks/disorder/grain boundaries/resistance within them on atleast one of the scales. Finding &amp; so engineering a material lego-block that can self-assemble into any such large structure or bulk material symmetrically without disruptions and near-perfect order would thus have immense implications. It would mean that any property we give the tiny sub-unit (the lego) would manifest itself in the entire scale range within the bulk matter (the building) in an also extremely ordered, symmetric manner, perfect in quality and purity (&gt;99%), and also be amplified as it is devoid of any of the disorder factors present in bulk materials. So, if we hypothetically found a subunit that is magnetic or fluorescent, we could build on top of it and generate a bulk material that would amplify the effect of that magnetism or fluorescence, and also display it many times larger without loss of property.</p>

<p>To overcome this challenge, we started with individual quantum dot magic sized clusters (which are super-tiny crystals ~1nm in size or roughly the width of 4 hydrogen atoms placed side-to-side. These are the smallest states of stable and ordered matter since atoms are usually inherently unstable and automatically interact with other atoms). By then binding a long-tailed ligand to it (an organic molecule in this case with the ability to stick to surfaces by means of electron donation or acceptance) we built a single sub-unit (which acts as the lego block). We observed that due to the properties of the tail (the stickiness) and the quantum-dot core (the rigidness and ordered shape) this lego block automatically spontaneously self-assembled into wired/filaments that then go on attract other wires and entangle to form a thicker rope. By then controlling the processing conditions of these ropes we were able to generate large sized full-fledged thin films that manifest all of the properties of this individual dot with minimal loss – such as optical activity, chirality, and hopefully soon magnetism.</p>

<h2 id="prior-sojourns">Prior Sojourns</h2>
<p>Prior to my work at Cornell, I was a Project Assistant at Prof. Julia Ortony’s lab in MIT, in the Department of Materials Science (DMSE), on self-assembling energy materials prior to which I was a Research assistant at Prof. Shafiee’s lab in Harvard Medical School working on rapid and cheap point-of-care diagnostics for HIV and HCV diagnosis (Published in ACS Nano and Nature Communications). and an undergraduate Thesis student at the Indian institute of Chemical Technology (IICT). I completed my undergraduation with a Bachelor’s in Chemical Engineering and a Master’s in Chemistry from BITS Pilani, India.</p>

<h2 id="views-on-energy">Views on Energy</h2>
<p>Access to minimum energy, even today, remains a distant dream for nearly 1.1 billion individuals by UN estimates. That people still live in wretched conditions of no power despite extravagant power consumption elsewhere, is unfortunate. When we get vexed at just an hour’s power-outage, it is not difficult to imagine the plight of people under perennial darkness. An individual should, at any time, at any place, have the capability to meet one’s own energy needs, without being subject to governmental, societal, or physical constraints. That, is my firm belief. My interests thus lie in anything that facilitates this ‘self-sustenance’ through efficient semiconductor systems or material systems that are achieved from such material or process engineering innovations.</p>

<h2 id="chemysteryorg">Chemystery.org</h2>
<p>Science, engineering, and art are, to me, major avenues to bring about larger emotional harmony and peace, and creative forms of personal liberation. The wide reach and the collective unity they bring about among all of us is especially needed in the trying times right now. As a materials enthusiast, this website is just an attempt at popularizing a fun approach towards materials science and deconvoluting some mechanisms behind their working. I have plans to expand this that have not materialized yet, but have some exciting developments, so watch out for this space! If nothing at best, just take a look and have fun!</p>

<p>This site is dedicated to all those interested in this pursuit.
Love ❤️
– Shan</p>
